# What is type inference in TypeScript? Why is it helpful?
Type inference is a nice feature in Typescript. It means when we assign a value to a variable Typescript can understand what type it is. So we dont need to always write the type.
This is helpful for begginer because sometimes we forget to write types but Typescript still help us by guessing the type.But it doesnt mean we should always skip the type. In some complex case better to write the type manually.Using type inference makes our code more clean and easy to read.


# How Typescript improve code quality and maintainability?
Typescript help us to write better and safer code. It show error before we run the program. So we can fix mistake early. Also it help when many people work in same project because type make clear what a function or variable is suppose to do.
